## Google Admob Setup
  If you want to monetize this app, Google AdMob frames have already been set up. All you need is your AdMob app ID and AdUnit from your Google AdMob account. If you're unsure how to set up an app in AdMob, you can follow this link to create one.

  After creating an app in AdMob, you will receive an ``APPID``. Copy this APPID and paste it into the ``app.json`` file in your project's root folder, as shown in the following example:
```json
{
  "name": "Mobile POS",
  "displayName": "Mobile POS",

  "react-native-google-mobile-ads":{
    "android_app_id":"ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890", // Replace the APPID Here
    "ios_app_id":"ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890", // Replace the APPID Here
  }
}

```
### Changing Your Ad Unit
  In this app, Banner Ads and Interstital Ads are include. So you should need to create both banner and interstital ads. If you don't know how to create adunit, you can follow this to create.

  After creating the Ad Units, copy the Ad Unit IDs for both types of ads. Then, open the ``Database.js`` file located in the project's root folder. Find the UnitId and paste the Ad Unit ID for each type of ad as shown below:

...
export const UnitId = {
  banner : 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111',
